# Welcome to Reddit Purple

## About

This project offers a better experience for a very niche use-case: When browsing Reddit, there are sometimes posts asking about other Reddit posts. 

>For example, a post on [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/) may ask "What is your favourite Reddit post?"

These threads are gold mines of content, but annoying to browse because it requires going back and forth through all the links in the comments. Instead of a heap of purple links, this app will display all the linked posts automatically in an easier-to-digest format. 

The extension subdirectory is a standalone Chrome extension that automatically detects when the user is on a page with other Reddit posts linked in the comments. It turns 'on' and the user can toggle between seeing the original webpage and seeing a clean display of all the linked posts/comments.

## Demo

See the extension in action as it simplifies the browsing experience for [What's your favorite Reddit post that you have under "Saved"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7b5jzx/whats_your_favorite_reddit_post_that_you_have/)
