# Welcome to Reddit Purple

## About

This project offers a better experience for a very niche use-case: When browsing Reddit, there are sometimes posts asking about other Reddit posts. 

>For example, a post on r/AskReddit may ask "What is your favourite Reddit post?"

These threads are gold mines of content, but annoying to browse because it requires going back and forth through all the links in the comments. Instead of a heap of purple links, this app will display all the linked posts automatically in an easier-to-digest format. 

As of now, the user must paste a link to the top-level post into the app manually. Soon, it will be set up as a Chrome extension and automatically detect when the user is on a page where it would improve the experience.

## Tools

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. 

This app also makes use of [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
