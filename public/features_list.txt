What do we want it to do?
Users can browse posts linked by 'top threads' with previes instead of comment hyperlinks.

How will it work?
Users paste a reddit URL with 'top thread' post, and the hyperlinks will tell the app which posts to render.

Next level: Identify posts that are about memorable posts in Reddit history and automatically render.

Broad Strokes Implementation:
-UI describes/shows how it works and the URL input field
    -validate that the link is to a reddit post that has other posts/comments linked (either in post or in comments)
-Component to find hyperlinks in post
    -Filter down to Reddit post and comment links
-Component to display posts (and comments) on the page (previews?)
    -Each item is clickable and links to the full comment/post
-CSS/styling for display page

-InputField Component:
    -checkForLinks(redditPostLink)
        -checks post and comments for links to other reddit posts/comment
    -update state with URL
    -export selector for URL in state

-FindHyperlinksToReddit Component:
    -filterHyperlinks(JSONdata) {
        // Find hyperlinks to Reddit posts and comments
    }
    -(Maybe) limit by specified number
    -Eliminate duplicates
    -update state with array of links
    -export selector for array of links

-DisplayPosts Component:
    -Take JSON data from each link in state array
    -add array of post objects to state
    -map over array of post objects in state to render a Post Component for each
    -pass post object prop to each <Post />

-Post Component:
    -displays data for a single post or comment
        -title, date, author, comments, image, award(s)?, cat tax?, net upvotes?
    -routes to new page that displays the post in full with more comments
    -button to link to original reddit post or comment

-FilterResults Component:
    -user can filter or sort by some criteria 
        -date, subreddit, upvotes, post length?, gold or specific award, search word
