# To Do

 - Option for script to run on non-reddit pages (like Buzzfeed)
 - Duplicate posts linking to diff comments
 - iframe to a page that doesn't exist anymore
   - example on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/58hae4/what_is_a_piece_of_reddit_history_every_redditor/) post for link to NSFW_GIF

   -postScrubber.js: add function to check og page's json data for links to other posts. compare it to the links found from the DOM and then ship the bigger list.
